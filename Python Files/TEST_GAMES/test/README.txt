base - The base of the game. Two folders; base and sprites.
	basescripts - Used for the base of the game, has a folder, engscripts, and a script, initengscripts.py
		engscripts - Used for scripts that make up the engine of the game. The scripts are pygamebase.py,
		initengscripts.py - Takes scripts from /engscripts/, and combines them into one. Makes it easier to call for the base rather than calling all scripts from /engscripts/.
	enginesprites - The default sprites.
